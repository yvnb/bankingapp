# bankingapp
Design Considerations:

This Application is for creating Banking API for account transfer/deposit as well as display transactions for end users. 
This Application is based on Spring Boot with Swagger Open API 3.0 support and uses Inmemory HsqlDB for persistence with Spring Data JPA.
Users are authenticated using JWT token generated from user credentials and the Rest API's are secured with JWT token.
